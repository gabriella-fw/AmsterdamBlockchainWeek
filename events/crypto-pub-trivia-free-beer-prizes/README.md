### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://amsterdamblockchainweek.org/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

    Shell Protocol v2 is a breakthrough paradigm for building and composing financial primitives like AMMs, lending pools, or algorithmic stablecoins. It lets you build capital-efficient AMMs that can evolve over time, design transactions with seamless atomic composability, and transact with up to 4x cheaper gas costs.
  -
    With Shell’s Proteus AMM engine, financial engineers can precisely implement any trading strategy and build bonding curves that can evolve over time. It allows concentrated liquidity with fungible LP tokens, and lets users design custom AMMs without ever writing a line of Solidity code.
  -
    Beyond trading pools, Shell v2’s Ocean provides a better, simpler, cheaper base layer for the entire DeFi ecosystem. It’s three things in one -> a shared multi-token ledger, a standardized accounting framework, and a system for instant composability with the entire Shell network.
