### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://amsterdamblockchainweek.org/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:

    Hallo en welkom! As part of our Amsterdam Blockchain Week programming, we have taken over a warehouse in Amsterdam and planned an epic gathering for the melding of the minds. As we all work together to build the future of Ethereum and Web3, this is a space designed for all blockchain builders to learn about bridging, interoperability, & hang out in Amsterdam.
  -
    Join us on 4/20 at Lofi, programming details coming soon. The morning will kick off with technical workshops for developers (and a traditional Dutch breakfast!)... then the afternoon will open up to everyone interested in interoperability with a series of  talks, panels, and a happy hour in the garden.

    Hosted by Connext, Entropy, Nomad, Celestia and the Catwalk Society.
